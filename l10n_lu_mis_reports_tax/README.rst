Technical notes
===============

The Luxembourg Tax Analysis report is generated by the ``gen_mis_tax_analysis.py``
script in the ``scripts`` directory, which takes as input the tax tags in
``data/account.account.tag-2015.csv``. Should these tags be modified, the script
must be adapted and re-run.

These tax tags are those that were found in Odoo before 2017-08-29
(before PR https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/19102 was merged).
